# sixLittle
## **Hunter Sloan**
## **3 Liked**
1. Readability both for the anyone else and the programmer
2. OOD nature for running game cleanly by creating an instance of the class six_little_game
3. The methods available in ruby like: map, scan, flatten, and shuffle. These made it super easy to perform operations with minimal coding
 **4 no like**
1. Reliance on standard Ruby implementation for randomness without really allowing for more fine tuning with randomization
2. Not a huge fan of the @ symnbols used throughout ruby, more from an aesthetic and personal preference perspective
3. Usage of the word "nil" 
4. Having to backspace through the code to adjust things versus the editing freedom other things use
